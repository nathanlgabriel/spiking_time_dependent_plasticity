# spiking_time_dependent_plasticity
developing code and documentation of STDP network simulations that are accessible to philosophers


current goal is to replicate the model and simulation results of "Sleep prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks by forming a joint synaptic weight representation" Golden R, Delanois JE, Sanda P, Bazhenov M (2022) Sleep prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks by forming a joint synaptic weight representation.
